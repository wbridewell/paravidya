abstract: "In this paper, we introduce an inductive logic programming approach to learning declarative bias. The target learning task is inductive process modeling, which we briefly review. Next we discuss our approach to bias induction while emphasizing predicates that characterize the knowledge and models associated with the HIPM system. We then evaluate how the learned bias affects the space of model structures that HIPM considers and how well it generalizes to other search problems in the same domain. Results indicate that the bias reduces the size of the search space without removing the most accurate structures. In addition, our approach reconstructs known constraints in population dynamics. We conclude the paper by discussing a generalization of the technique to learning bias for inductive logic programming and by noting directions for future work."
