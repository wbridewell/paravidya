abstract: "Social cognition is a key feature of human-level intelligence. However, social reasoning faculties are rarely included in cognitive systems. To encourage research in this direction, we introduce a practical, computational framework that enables socially aware inference. We demonstrate the framework's ability to model a common, complex, and under-investigated aspect of human social behavior: deception. Moreover, we show how a system implementing this framework could dynamically respond once it has detected a lie. We then discuss some of the challenges associated with deception, ending with an outline of future research directions."
