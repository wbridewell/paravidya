abstract: "In this paper, we explore the representational and inferential requirements for supporting a rich notion of belief revision. Our analysis extends beyond the typical case of a single agent revising its beliefs in light of new information into the realm of social engagement. More to the point, we argue that, although belief revision mechanisms surely operate at the level of single agents, we must also consider the need to lift an agent’s understanding of the belief revision process to the knowledge level in order to intentionally guide other agents’ revision processes with whom it socially interacts. In exploring belief revision at the knowledge level, we identify reasons for rejecting classical formulations of the problem and identify constraints by which alternative accounts must abide."
