abstract: "This article provides an overview of, and thematic justification for, the special issue of the journal of Artificial Intelligence and Law entitled \"E-Discovery\". In attempting to define a characteristic \"AI & Law\" approach to e-discovery, and since a central theme of AI & Law involves computationally modeling legal knowledge, reasoning and decision making, we focus on the theme of representing and reasoning with litigators' theories or hypotheses about document relevance through a variety of techniques including machine learning. We also identify two emerging techniques for enabling users' document queries to better express the theories of relevance and connect them to documents: social network analysis and a hypothesis ontology."
