abstract: "In this paper, we review the main qualitative characteristics of everyday inference in human cognition and present a computational account that is consistent with them. This includes both a representational framework and associated processes that produce abductive explanations in a flexible, incremental, and efficient manner. We clarify our approach with examples and report some initial empirical results. In closing, we examine related work and suggest directions for future research."
