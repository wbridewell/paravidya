abstract: "Recent studies in the perception of numerosity have indicated that subitizing (the rapid and accurate enumeration of small quantities) requires attention. We present a novel computational model of enumeration in which attention unifies distinct processes of numerosity approximation, subitizing, and explicit counting. We demonstrate how this model accounts for both the reaction time results from the subitizing literature and the effects of attentional load on subitizing accuracy."
