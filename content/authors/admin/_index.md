Will Bridewell is a research scientist at the Navy Center for Applied Research in Artificial Intelligence. His research interests include computational approaches that integrate perception, action, and cognition. He is currently investigating the relationship between intentional action and mechanisms of attention. He is a principle investigator in the Interactive Systems section where he develops the ARCADIA cognitive system.

In the past, he has worked in science informatics, health informatics, ecological informatics, inductive process modeling, transfer learning, deception, explanation of anomalies, natural language processing, and abductive inference.
